# AI-Idea

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI that helps people who are visiting a new city know what the best restaurants are to eat at

## Background

Most of the time when you visit a new city, you would like to eat somewhere but don't now where or what. With the AI you can tell him what you like and how much you would like to pay. Then depending on your input the AI returns a list with places that best fit your needs.


## How is it used?

Most of the time when you visit a new city, you would like to eat somewhere but don't now where or what. With the AI you can tell him what you like and how much you would like to pay. Then depending on your input the AI returns a list with places that best fit your needs.



## Data sources and AI methods
The data will come from website from the restaurants on the web for prices names and menu's and on the maps for the distance.

## What next?

I would like it to continue with when you are in a city it automatically knows what you like to eat and pay and instantly gives you the list without having always to give input.
